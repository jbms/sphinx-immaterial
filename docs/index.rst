        :alt: Material for Sphinx Screenshots

This theme is an adaptation of the popular `mkdocs-material
<https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/>`__ theme for the `Sphinx
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`__ documentation tool.

This theme is regularly maintained to stay up to date with the upstream
`mkdocs-material <https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/>`__ repository.
The HTML templates, JavaScript, and styles from the `mkdocs-material
<https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/>`__ theme are incorporated directly
with mostly minor modifications.

Independent of the upstream mkdocs-material theme, this theme integrates with
and significantly extends Sphinx's API documentation functionality.

This theme is a fork of the `sphinx-material
<https://github.com/bashtage/sphinx-material>`__ theme, which proved the concept
of a Sphinx theme based on an earlier version of the `mkdocs-material
<https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/>`__ theme, but has now
significantly diverged from the upstream `mkdocs-material
<https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/>`__ repository.

Getting Started
---------------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the PyPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install sphinx-immaterial

From git source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/jbms/sphinx-immaterial.git

.. admonition:: Prerequisites

    Building the theme from source requires node.js v14 or newer installed.
    Please be aware that readthedocs.org uses a docker image that might have
    an outdated version of node.js installed. Installing node.js from a Unix package
    manager may not provide version 14 or newer.

    Installing from a distributed wheel (such as from pypi.org) does not require
    node.js installed.


Sphinx configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update your ``conf.py`` with the required changes:

.. code-block:: python

    extension = ["sphinx_immaterial"]
    # ...
    html_theme = "sphinx_immaterial"


There are a lot more ways to customize this theme. See :ref:`Customization`
or ``theme.conf`` for more details.

.. example:: Settings used in this documentation
    :collapsible:

    .. literalinclude:: ./conf.py
