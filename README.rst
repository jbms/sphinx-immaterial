Sphinx-Immaterial Theme
=======================

|MIT License| |PyPI Package| |CI status|

This theme is an adaptation of the popular `mkdocs-material
<https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/>`__ theme for the `Sphinx
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`__ documentation tool.

This theme is regularly maintained to stay up to date with the upstream
`mkdocs-material <https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/>`__ repository.
The HTML templates, JavaScript, and styles from the `mkdocs-material
<https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/>`__ theme are incoroprated directly
with mostly minor modifications.

This theme is a fork of the `sphinx-material
<https://github.com/bashtage/sphinx-material>`__ theme, which proved the concept
of a Sphinx theme based on an earlier version of the `mkdocs-material
<https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/>`__ theme, but has now
significantly diverged from the upstream `mkdocs-material
<https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/>`__ repository.

See the `TensorStore documentation <https://google.github.io/tensorstore/>`__
for a demonstration of this theme.

WARNING: This theme is currently still a work in progress.  The documentation is
largely copied from `sphinx-material
<https://github.com/bashtage/sphinx-material>`__ and is inaccurate for this
version.  It does not yet integrate well with numpydoc or the built-in
autosummary.

Installation
------------

Install via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install sphinx-immaterial

or if you have the code checked out locally:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip -install -e .

Configuration
-------------

In your `conf.py` add `sphinx_immaterial` as an extension:

.. code-block:: python

    extensions = [
        ...,
        "sphinx_immaterial"
    ]

and add the following:

.. code-block:: python

    html_theme = 'sphinx_immaterial'

to set the theme.

Customizing the layout
----------------------

You can customize the theme by overriding Jinja template blocks. For example,
'layout.html' contains several blocks that can be overridden or extended.

Place a 'layout.html' file in your project's '/_templates' directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir source/_templates
    touch source/_templates/layout.html

Then, configure your 'conf.py':

.. code-block:: python

    templates_path = ['_templates']

Finally, edit your override file 'source/_templates/layout.html':

::

    {# Import the theme's layout. #}
    {% extends '!layout.html' %}

    {%- block extrahead %}
    {# Add custom things to the head HTML tag #}
    {# Call the parent block #}
    {{ super() }}
    {%- endblock %}

Differences from mkdocs-material
--------------------------------

This theme closely follows the upstream `mkdocs-material
<https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/>`__ repository, but there are a
few differences, primarily due to differences between Sphinx and MkDocs:

- This theme adds styles for Sphinx object descriptions, commonly used for API
  documentation (e.g. class and function documentation).  This is a core element
  of Sphinx for which there is no corresponding feature in MkDocs.

- mkdocs-material uses `lunr.js <https://lunrjs.com/>`__ for searching, and has
  custom UI components for displaying search results in a drop-down menu as you
  type the search query.  This theme uses a separate search implementation based
  on the custom index format used by Sphinx, which fully integrates with the
  search UI provided by mkdocs-material.
